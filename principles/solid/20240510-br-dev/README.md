# SOLID Principles

Learning SOLID through examples, following the course on: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jhML313S2Y&ab_channel=BrazilianDev>

S - Single Responsility Principle (SRP)

O - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

L - Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP)

I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Single Responsility Principle (SRP)

Each software entity (classes, modules, functions, etc.) must have only one responsility.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes are open for extension, but closed for internal modifications.

## Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Classes should not be forced to implement methods it doesn't need. In other words, a class should have small, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
